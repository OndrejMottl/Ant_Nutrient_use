Data from manuscript "Nutrient use by tropical ant communities varies among three extensive elevational gradients: a cross-continental comparison" are provided for peer-review

All details and metadata about datasets are posted in each of the excel files in the first "Metadata" sheet, in which the first row describes the content of each file 
and the other rows list each variable by its name and in the same order as in the second sheet (names of rows in Metadata = names of columns in the Data).  

There are four excel files with data:
AntPicnic_FullData.xlsx - contains complete raw data	
AntPicnic_diversity_data.xlsx - Dataset used to generete Table 1 and Table S1 stats, and Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (79 sites)
RelativeNutrientUse-Data.xlsx - contains data for individual nutrient types by individual 53 sites used for relative nutrient analyses (Figs. 3 and S2, Tables 2, S2 and S3), note the sites with less than 3 species occurrences are removed from this dataset (318 rows x 5 replications = 1590 baits)
AntPicnic_guilds_data.xlsx - contains data by individual 53 sites used for analyses on guild proportions (Fig. 4, Fig. S3, Table S4), and their effects on relative nutrient use (Table 2)
	
Further, there are 4 associated R codes to the datafiles that reproduce Analyses (Tables) and Figures:
AntPicnic_diversity_CODE (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1)
Occupancies_CODE (reproduces data from AntPicnic_FullData.xlsx used for proportional occupancies of baits and the Fig. 2)
RelativeNutrientUse_CODE (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2)
AntPicnic_guilds_CODE (Fig.4 and Fig. S3)
